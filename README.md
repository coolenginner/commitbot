This is a Github Commit Bot By SpeedX 
This could get you a lot of fake contributions by fake commits At A Great Speed!!!

This Script is Only For Educational Purposes 

Commit-Bot is a Tool which can give you fake contributions in your Github Account by making fake Commits!!! 
It Was Tested To Give 1000 contributions in 30 sec

[*]ALWAYS USE AN EMPTY REPOSITORY WITH AN INITIAL COMMIT FOR COMMIT BOT !!!

We Take The Following Inputs:

         Number Of Commits -   To Generate That Amount Of Fake Commits
         Repository URL    -   To Push And Pull Code To/From That Repository
                               (Must be from the account You Want To Increase Contributions)
         Github Username   -   Sometimes Github Asks For UserName (Enter A Real One) ...
         Github Email      -   Sometimes Github Asks For Email (Enter A Real One) ...

We Never Keep You Github Username, Email or Password...
If You Don't Trust Us The  Push The Repository Yourself After Successful Commit, Use Command
```git push -u --force origin master```

# NOTE
 NOTE: It is Only For Educational Purposes.

[*]ALWAYS USE AN EMPTY REPOSITORY WITH AN INITIAL COMMIT FOR COMMIT BOT
[*]REMEMBER TO ENTER CORRECT USERNAME AND PASSWORD WHEN THE BOT IS PUSHING YOUR REPO TO GITHUB...'
   AS AN INCORRECT PASSWORD OR USERNAME COULD LEAD TO LOSS YOUR COMMITS BY BOT, UNLESS PROPERLY HANDLED !!
   SO ALWAYS BE SURE THRICE WHILE ENTERING YOUR INFOS ...
   If you want To Increase Commits of a non-empty repo:
   [-] Backup Your Code To Another Place
   [-] Make Sure Repository Size Is Not Too Big
   [-] Use At Your Own Risk .... 
[*]The Repository Must be From Same Account From Which You Want Increase Contribution
[*]No Commits Should Be Made Externally To The Repository That Bot is using Unless it is Pushed To Github
[*]If You Don't See Your Commits/Contributions in Github Site:
   [-] Go Into test Directory inside commit-bot directory
   [-] Push the Code With ```git push -u --force origin master```

[+] UPCOMING FEATURE
    ->  Get Any Amount Of Contribution With Any Amount of Commit [ So That No-One Could Find it ;-) ]
    [?] It means you can get 1k contribution with 1 commit or 100 commits as you wish...
       Uses A Bug in Github Which isn't Fixed Till Now...
       Don't Know if it works on for all users or for me xD
       As I got 3k+ contribution in 3 commits !!! xD
       So Code Testers Are Needed .....
